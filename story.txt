One day our stunning and beautiful Professor Mehlhase was walking the streets of Berlin.
Sie liebte es brot zu essen. (She loved to eat bread).
Pulled up in a bmw with cookies.
Is she walking? driving? Mehlhase didn't know due to her concept of time being absolutely messed up because of a long crazy day at the local beirgarten.
She went to the nearest baeckerei and asked what they had on the menu.
The baker said apple pie and bread. 
But she said "I don't want gebaeck! I want a bratwurst and beer instead!"
The baker grimaced, and asked the professor to leave with her hund. 
"We are not agile in our menu like that, so leave with your porsche!" 
Mehlhase's eyes started glowing, and her body lifted off the ground ominously flowing with life energy, and with an almighty push she sent the baker and his beckerei to Schloss Eltz (Eltz Castle) leaving behind gruesome mass destruction. 
Hearing all the noise, the hund in the ratskeller started to ascend.
She then took off in her car on the hauptstrasse going at least 200mph, weaving in and out of traffic while running from the cops.
She intended to drive to the Flughafen in order to flee the country.
While blasting Rammstein, she somehow caught a glipse of a cop wearting a dirndel.
Eventually she somehow ended up at the flughafen driving down the runway heading straight towards an airplane.
What a day she was having. If only she wasn't so wettbewerbsfaehig.
